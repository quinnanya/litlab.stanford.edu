  blurb: "The object of this study is one of the most ambitious projects of twentieth-century art history: Aby Warburg’s *Atlas Mnemosyne*, conceived in the summer of 1926 – when the first mention of a *Bilderatlas*, or “atlas of images”, occurs in his journal—and truncated three years later, unfinished, by his sudden death in October 1929."
