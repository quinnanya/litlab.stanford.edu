On April 9th, 2018, Mark Algee-Hewitt, J.D. Porter and Hannah Walser presented their latest work on the Identity Project.

“Representations of Race and Identity in American Fiction” explores the changing discourse of identity in the American Novel from the late eighteenth to the early nineteenth century. As the project moves toward publication, we wanted to share our latest work with the lab, including new visualizations of the discourse of the novel and a new set of findings on the “stickiness” of identity labels that have shifted the goals and outcomes of the research. We are particularly eager to think through the implication of these findings with the lab before we submit the piece for publication.
