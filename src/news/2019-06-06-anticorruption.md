The OECD Working Group on Bribery (WGB) is one of the key institutions for addressing corruption in trade between wealthy nations. Yet its disciplinary powers are quite limited, consisting mainly of “naming and shaming” via harshly worded reports and press releases. In this project, a collaboration between the Literary Lab and Colombian legal scholars Laura Galindo-Romero and Mariana Rozo Paz, we explore the publications of the OECD through sentiment, distinctive words, and coded sections of “harsh” language, exploring the effectiveness and the biases that underlie the reports and press releases.
