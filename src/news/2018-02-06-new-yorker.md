On February 6th, 2018, Nichole Nomura led a discussion about the New Yorker in the Literary Lab.

This was somewhat different from ordinary Lab meetings in that we developed multiple research questions that could benefit from the New Yorker corpus, and discussed how we want to tag and sort the corpus to facilitate answering those questions.
