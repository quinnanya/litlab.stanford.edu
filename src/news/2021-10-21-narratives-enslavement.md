On October 21st, 2021, Professor Grant Parker of the Classics Department, along with his South African Collaborators, presented on their project Narratives of Enslavement.

A new project throws up more questions than answers: I am part of a project that seeks to digitally republish transcripts of legal cases involving enslaved persons at the Cape of Good Hope (1705-94). This is a chance to scrutinize the notion of ‘slave narrative’, comparing the Cape trial records with other histories. The most urgent question is: What notion of narrative is most productive for these court trials, and what are the implications for their digitization?
