On March 8th, 2019, Abigail Droge presented her project, "WhatEvery1Says: Interpreting Student Responses to the Humanities."

Abigail Droge, a Lit Lab alum and current postdoc at UC Santa Barbara, shared research from the digital humanities project WhatEvery1Says (WE1S), based at UCSB, CSU Northridge and the University of Miami. The project uses digital methods to understand public discourse around the humanities in popular media since the 1980s, with the ultimate goal of using that research to inform the creation of humanities advocacy resources. This talk will focus on topic models made from sources particularly related to the student experience of the humanities in higher education. What associations do students make with the humanities and how might an understanding of this landscape help us to increase the accessibility and impact of humanistic disciplines? The talk will also focus on the intersections between digital humanities and other methodologies, such as human subjects research.
