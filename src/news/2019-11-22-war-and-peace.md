The most fascinating question about Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece is why this tremendous novel with more than 500 characters and exhausting historical and philosophical excursus is so still so vivid, being read and also serves as a source for plays, series and opera? Is there some hidden construction inside the text, that supports its plot and composition?
In my talk I'll introduce the concept of complex layer analysis and I'll show how the combination of 5 different distant reading methods applied to one novel help to reveal rigid  structure of inner oppositions and bring some new insights about Tolstoy's art as device.
