This project seeks to develop an AI model for the identification and extraction of passages of domestic fiction from 19th Century British novels. Using this model, we locate and examine passages with a high degree of domesticity set outside of conventional domestic spaces (wilderness scenes, ships, carceral institions), as well as those in colonial, classed and otherwise strongly market settings in order to tease out the construction of domesticity that undergrids the period's fictional and highly gendered economy of attention: what kinds of labour are represented when done by whom?
