The Harry Potter franchise is a global phenomenon, with books and films translated into hundreds of languages. While readers and viewers worldwide have the same point of departure, the fan fiction responses to that material diverge in ways that are shaped by shaped by language and culture (both national cultures and the community cultures of particular fanfic archives).
