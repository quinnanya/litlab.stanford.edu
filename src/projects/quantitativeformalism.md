shortdesc: "Tried to establish whether computer-generated algorithms could “recognize” literary genres."
longdesc: "You take David Copperfield, run it through a program without any human input – “unsupervised”, as the expression goes – and … can the program figure out whether it’s a gothic novel or a Bildungsroman? The answer is, fundamentally, Yes: but a Yes with so many complications that make it necessary to look at the entire process of our study."
